## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps

### Option 1: MySQL Setup (Recommended for Production)

#### Step 1: Install MySQL

```bash
# Install MySQL via Homebrew (macOS)
brew install mysql

# Start MySQL service
brew services start mysql

# Secure MySQL installation (optional but recommended)
mysql_secure_installation
```

#### Step 2: Create Database User

```bash
# Connect to MySQL as root
mysql -u root -p

# In MySQL console, create a user and database
CREATE DATABASE garrison;
CREATE USER 'entry_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON garrison.* TO 'entry_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```

#### Step 3: Update Environment Variables

Update `.env` file with your MySQL credentials:

```
PORT=3000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=entry_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=garrison
```

#### Step 4: Run Database Setup

```bash
node setup-database.js
```

### Option 2: SQLite Setup (Quick Development)

If you want to skip MySQL setup for now, you can use SQLite:

#### Step 1: Install SQLite Dependencies

```bash
npm install sqlite3
```

#### Step 2: Use SQLite Configuration

We'll create a SQLite version for quick testing.
